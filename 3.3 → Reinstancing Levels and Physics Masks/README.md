# Reinstancing World Scenes and Physics Masks Demo

### Overview

Adapted from the [`3D Movement Demo`](https://github.com/Yuminous/Godot-Shorts/tree/main/3.3%20%E2%86%92%20Rudimentary%203D%20Movement%20incl.%20Flight), this is a basic demonstration of level or world switching [`without changing`](https://godotengine.org/qa/109821/4d-world-world-with-different-dimensions) the main scene, through the deletion and re-instancing of scenes. It also provides a small example of how physics layers can change how the player interacts with the environment.
